# BIM459 - AI in Healthcare Homework 3

Welcome to your third assignment, where you’ll be implementing key components of a Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Keras API](https://keras.io)! This document provides some pre-instructions before starting your homework. The instructions for your assignment will be provided in <b>”BIM459-HW3.ipynb”</b> file.

Your homework file is designed to be used in the [Google Colab](https://colab.google) environment. Therefore, you may encounter many errors if you try to run your code on your local computer. Also, it is recommended to use GPU instead of CPU in Google Colab because you have a large amount of training data and the CPU will process this data very slowly because it is not designed for this.
